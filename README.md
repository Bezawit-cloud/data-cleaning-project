# data-cleaning-project
A data cleaning project using SQL 
Data Cleaning Project – Ethiopian Job Dataset
This project focuses on cleaning a messy job listing dataset using SQL.  
I identified missing values, fixed inconsistent formatting, standardized categories, and removed duplicates.

 Files Included

- raw_dataset.cs – Original dataset
- cleaning_script.sql – SQL script used for data cleaning
- README.md – Project explanation

  Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL)


 Key Cleaning Tasks

- Removed null values from critical columns
- Standardized text (e.g., education level: Bachelor vs bachelor)
- Converted data types (e.g., salary from string to float)
- Removed outliers (e.g., unrealistic ages or salaries)
- Trimmed spaces and fixed typos

 Outcome
The cleaned dataset is now ready for analysis or visualization in Power BI or Python.
